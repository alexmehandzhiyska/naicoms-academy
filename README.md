# naicoms-academy

This repo is dedicated to all of the tasks I've completed during the Naicoms Academy 2022.
<br>
The courses I've completed during the program are:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. MySQL
5. PHP

<br>
I am currently working on my final project - an online bookstore. The front-end is created with HTML, CSS, and JS. The back-end is built with PHP and the data is stored into a DB using MySQL.
